"""Regression test for the RecursionError after model reload (observed on the
second generation when two adapter sets stack bypass hooks on the same modules).

Legacy behavior: injection sets are ejected in list order, which restores a
stale hook as module.forward; the next load then captures that hook as its own
"original" and the forward self-recurses. _install_injection's LIFO eject must
keep load/unload cycles stable. Run from anywhere with the ComfyUI venv python.
